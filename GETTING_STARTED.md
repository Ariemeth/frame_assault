# Go Game Jam: Getting Started
Welcome to Go Game Jam! 

**Please read this before starting**. It explains how the challenge works.

## What to make

**Any game, as long as it's written in Go**

The point is to learn Go (or master it) by making a game. It's great if you already know what you want to make. But if you don't, here are a few ideas:

* Your favorite old school console game, remade as a terminal version. Here's an [example](https://github.com/asib/spaceinvaders)

* A card game. Like [Sergeant Major](http://www.pagat.com/whist/sergeant.html), a trick taking game popular with the British Royal Air Force

* A roguelike (if you're truly sadistic)

* Games people made in [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/09/14/results-for-ludum-dare-33/)

* Something from [/r/GameIdeas](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas)

Choose anything you like! Just make sure it's something you can finish it in a weekend.


## How it works

1. Fork this repo. **Only forks of this repo will be included in the gallery at the end.**

2. Work as you please in your own fork. Just make sure you've pushed all of your commits to your fork's master branch before the challenge ends :)

3. Before the end, describe what you did in the `README.md` in your fork. Tell people how they can try it out, how you made it, and what the experience was like (people love good project post-mortems). **We'll be putting your `README.md` in the gallery, so make it good! If it's blank, we'll assume you don't want your project shown.**

###SF Meetup
If anyone's interested in meeting up in San Francisco on Sunday, sign up [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/codelympics-go-game-jam-meetup-in-sf-tickets-18767870205). You can bring your laptop and keep working on your game too. Make sure to RSVP!

##How to meet companies

Asana, IFTTT, and Streak are joining the challenge as [spectators](https://codelympics.io/blog/announcing-spectator-companies). They'll be checking out projects, and looking for people who make interesting things.

**If you're interested in hearing from them, answer a couple quick yes/no questions on your [profile page](https://codelympics.io/account).** You can also opt out from there too.
